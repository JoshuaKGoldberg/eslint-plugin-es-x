# es-x/no-set-prototype-intersection
> disallow the `Set.prototype.intersection` method

- ‚ùó <badge text="This rule has not been released yet." vertical="middle" type="error"> ***This rule has not been released yet.*** </badge>
- ‚úÖ The following configurations enable this rule: [no-new-in-esnext] and [no-set-methods]

This rule reports ES2025 [`Set.prototype.intersection`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-set-methods) methods as errors.

This rule is silent by default because it's hard to know types. You need to configure [the aggressive mode](../#the-aggressive-mode) or TypeScript in order to enable this rule.

## üí° Examples

‚õî Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

<eslint-playground type="bad">

```js
/*eslint es-x/no-set-prototype-intersection: error */
const a = new Set()
const b = new Set()
a.intersection(b)
```

</eslint-playground>
